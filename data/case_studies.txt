Convo Sol Case Studies & Product Highlights

Convo Sol has worked on several intelligent automation and AI-driven projects aimed at helping businesses streamline their operations and improve customer engagement. Below is an overview of one of our flagship projects and in-house products.

1. Voas — AI Voice Assistant for Food Businesses

Overview:
Voas is an AI-powered voice assistant developed by Convo Sol specifically for the food and restaurant industry. It automates customer communication — from taking orders to confirming deliveries — without human intervention.

The system integrates seamlessly with restaurant management tools, POS systems, and delivery platforms to provide a complete end-to-end solution for automating voice-based order handling.

Key Features:

Automated Call Handling:
Voas can answer incoming calls, understand customer requests, and handle entire conversations naturally through AI-driven speech recognition and synthesis.

Order Placement:
The system takes food orders directly over the call, confirms menu items, applies available deals, and forwards the order to the kitchen system or POS.

Payment & Confirmation:
Supports multiple payment methods, sends automated confirmation messages, and updates the customer about order status in real time.

Order Tracking & Updates:
Customers can call or ask Voas about their delivery status, estimated time, or previous order history — all handled via AI voice conversation.

Multilingual Capability:
Designed for regional markets; supports English, Urdu, and other local languages for a natural communication flow.

Technology Stack:

Speech-to-Text (STT): Whisper API

Text-to-Speech (TTS): OpenAI / Google Cloud TTS

AI Brain: RAG-enhanced LLM for intent understanding and contextual dialogue

Integration Layer: Node.js + Twilio for call automation

Backend: Flask + PostgreSQL for order management

Business Impact:
