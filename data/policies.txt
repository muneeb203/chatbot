Company Policies — Convo Sol
At Convo Sol, we believe in transparency, ethical practices, and open communication. Our policies ensure smooth collaboration, protect user data, and define mutual expectations between Convo Sol, its clients, and platform users.

1. Refund Policy

Convo Sol operates on a project-based and subscription-based model.

Refunds are available only in specific cases, such as service non-delivery, major technical failure not resolved within the agreed timeline, or duplicate payments.

For SaaS subscriptions, users may request a refund within 7 days of activation if the product fails to perform as described.

Custom development or AI integration projects are non-refundable once work has begun, as resources and development time are immediately allocated.
